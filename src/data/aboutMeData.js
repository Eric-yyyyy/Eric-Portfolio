		bio: "I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and immersive system design. I enjoy building interactive tools that bridge the physical and digital worlds, with a focus on how real-time feedback, embodiment, and sensing technologies can enhance learning and user experience. My work often explores how emerging XR technologies can support creativity, accessibility, and human-centered interaction rather than purely technical efficiency.",

		bio: "I have hands-on experience developing AR/VR applications using Unity and the Meta Quest platform, including projects such as a VR piano assistant that overlays real-time visual feedback onto a physical keyboard. In addition to XR development, I have worked on full-stack and frontend projects using React, TypeScript, and modern web frameworks. Through these projects, I aim to combine engineering rigor with design thinking, prototyping interactive systems that are both technically robust and grounded in user needs.",

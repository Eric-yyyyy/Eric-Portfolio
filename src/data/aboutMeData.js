		bio: "I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Virtual Reality (VR), and immersive system design. I enjoy building interactive tools that bridge the physical and digital worlds, with a focus on how real-time feedback, embodiment, and sensing technologies can enhance learning and user experience. My work often explores how emerging XR technologies can support creativity, accessibility, and human-centered interaction rather than purely technical efficiency.",

		bio: "Through hands-on prototyping of immersive systems, I explore how XR and interactive technologies can support intuitive and expressive user experiences. In parallel, I have experience building full-stack and frontend applications using modern web technologies. Across projects, I aim to combine engineering rigor with design thinking, creating interactive systems that are both technically robust and grounded in real user needs.",
